Rundown provides automation to Markdown. In the simplest case, this allows you to render Markdown documentation in the console. In the advanced case, your markdown files are turned into complete CLI or Web applications.

<r norun reveal/>

``` bash
brew install elseano/taps/rundown
```


Rundown's philosophy is that executable documentation is always better, but it shouldn't get in the way of just reading the document itself. 

Some of the usecases rundown suits are:

* Automated setup guides
* Tutorials
* Code building scripts
* Simple programs
* Operational support scripts
