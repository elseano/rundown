# This is a heading

This text should **be bold**.

This text should be _italic_.

This text `should be code`.

This text:

* Should be
* Bullet points

And this text

``` ruby reveal norun
def is_just_for_show
  true
end
```

We should also see output from an actual run:

``` bash reveal
echo "Hi"
```

Sequential runs should be placed together:

``` bash
echo "Hi"
```

``` bash
echo "Hi"
```

``` bash
echo "Hi"
```

Sequential runs with a middle reveal should be spaced.

``` bash
echo "Hi"
```

``` bash reveal
echo "Hi"
```

``` bash
echo "Hi"
```


## Additionally

Subheadings will be indented.

We also support ~~strikethrough~~!

* Bullets 
* should be 
* indented correctly

1. So should
2. Numbered
3. Lists


### Indenting

Goes quite deep.

#### But

At 4 levels we don't do much.
