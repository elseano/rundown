# This is a heading

This text should **be bold**.

This text should be _italic_.

This text `should be code`.

This is [a link](http://www.google.com).

This text:

* Should be
* Bullet points

And this text

``` ruby reveal norun
def is_just_for_show
  true
end
```

We should also see output from an actual run:

``` bash reveal
echo "Hi"
```

Sequential runs should be placed together:

``` bash
echo "Hi"
```

``` bash
echo "Hi"
```

``` bash
echo "Hi"
```

Sequential runs with a middle reveal should be spaced.

``` bash
echo "Hi"
```

``` bash reveal
echo "Hi"
```

``` bash
echo "Hi"
```


## Additionally

Subheadings will be indented.

We also support ~~strikethrough~~!

* Bullets 
* should be 
* indented correctly
* Really long bullet points will be wrapped, and they will be wrapped at the indentation level of the start of the bullet point text so it looks nice.
  * Indented, and the wrapping should also observe that we're indented on wrap an extra two spaces because this is a sub-bullet.
* And back to normal should work as expected as well given we just deintented the line again.

### Indenting

Goes quite deep.

#### But

At 4 levels we don't do much.

However, thematic breaks ignore heading levels.

----

This should still be indented at level 4.
