# Rundown Documentation

By default, Rundown will execute a `RUNDOWN.md` file, looking in the current directory upwards until it's found.

## Writing Rundown flavoured Markdown

Rundown flavoured Markdown is designed to be ignored by markdown renderers, so a Rundown file should appear as a normal Markdown file when viewing it in popular mediums, such as GitHub, GitLab, etc.
