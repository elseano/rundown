# Stop Commands

Stop commands allow you to terminate early, with either a success or failure state.

## Stop Ok <r section="ok" />

The simplest form will terminate the script with an exit code of `0`.

``` markdown
I will be rendered.

<r stop-ok />

I will not be rendered.
```

Will result in the output of:

``` expected
I will be rendered.
```

## Stop Fail <r section="fail" />

The simplest form will terminate the script with an exit code of `1`.

``` markdown
I will be rendered.

<r stop-fail />

I will not be rendered.
```

Will result in the output of:

``` expected-err
I will be rendered.
```

## Messages

There are two ways to present messages using `stop-ok` and `stop-fail`:

* `<r stop-ok="Message"/>` For when the message should only be visible when using rundown.
* `<r stop-ok>Message</r>` For both rundown and markdown.

## Conditionals

Using the `if` attribute, you can provide a shell command to determine if the `stop-ok` or `stop-fail` is executed. A zero return means to execute, while a non-zero means ignore.

The shell commands should be kept simple. Any errors in the script will be treated as a false result. For more complex scripts, consider prepending with an execution block with `capture-env`.

## Examples

### Example 1 <r section="ex1" />

``` markdown
I will be rendered.

<r stop-ok="I will not be rendered" if="false" />

I will also be rendered.
```

``` expected
I will be rendered.

I will also be rendered.
```

### Example 2 <r section="ex2" />

``` markdown
I will be rendered.

<r stop-ok="I will be rendered, too." if="true" />

I will not be rendered.
```

Will result in the output of:

``` expected
I will be rendered.

I will be rendered, too.
```

### Example 3 <r section="ex3" />

``` markdown
I will be rendered.

<r stop-ok if="true">I will be rendered in both Rundown and Markdown</r>
```

Will result in the output of:

``` expected
I will be rendered.

I will be rendered in both Rundown and Markdown
```

### Example 4 <r section="ex4" />

``` markdown
I will be rendered.

<r stop-ok if="false">I will be rendered in Markdown only.</r>
